In essence, cooking — including not only heat but also mechanical processes such as chopping and grinding — outsources some of the body's work of digestion so that more energy is extracted from food and less expended in processing it. Cooking breaks down collagen, the connective tissue in meat, and softens the cell walls of plants to release their stores of starch and fat. The calories to fuel the bigger brains of successive species of hominids came at the expense of the energy-intensive tissue in the gut, which was shrinking at the same time — you can actually see how the barrel-shaped trunk of the apes morphed into the comparatively narrow-waisted Homo sapiens. Cooking freed up time, as well; the great apes spend four to seven hours a day just chewing, not an activity that prioritizes the intellect.
本质上来说，烹饪——不仅包括加热，还包括切割和研磨等物理加工过程——分担了人体的一部分消化工作，从而人体就可以被提取更多能量，减少加工过程中所耗费的能量。烹饪使胶原蛋白、肉类中的结缔组织得到分解，还可以软化植物细胞壁，从而释放出其中所贮藏的淀粉和脂肪。随着人类科属物种大脑的不断变大，原本大量消耗能量的内脏组织，会有一部分卡路里转向供应大脑，此时内脏则不断缩小——从猿人的水桶腰到智人相对较细的腰围，你可以从这一进化过程中看出究竟。烹调还可以节省时间；猿人每天光咀嚼就要花4到7个小时的时间，而咀嚼并不是智人所关心的首要问题。
