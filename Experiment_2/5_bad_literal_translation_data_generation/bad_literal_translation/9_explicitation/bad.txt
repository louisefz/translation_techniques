Much of the discussion focused on the financially shaky Medicare health program for seniors, an issue of new prominence since Mitt Romney named Mr. Ryan as his running mate Saturday on the Republican ticket.

The campaign will now test how the broader electorate views those plans, including proposals to substantially change Medicare that align with Mr. Romney's platform.

So how does this play out beyond the lab? I saw the healing process up close after my 74-year-old husband, who is also a writer, suffered a left-hemisphere stroke that wiped out a lifetime of language. All he could utter was" mem. "Mourning the loss of our duet of decades, I began exploring new ways to communicate, through caring gestures, pantomime, facial expressions, humor, play, empathy and tons of affection — the brain's epitome of a safe attachment. That, plus the admittedly eccentric home schooling I provided, and his diligent practice, helped rewire his brain to a startling degree, and in time we were able to talk again, he returned to writing books, and even his vision improved. The brain changes with experience throughout our lives; it's in loving relationships of all sorts — partners, children, close friends — that brain and body really thrive.

These exploits could range from stealing credit card information from small vendors to even more dramatic forms of theft, many of them easily circumventing external security measures such as the semi-closed payments network. Botezatu says there have been reports of an ATM exploit through a mobile phone connected through an ATM's card reader. He also cites a legendary stunt by the security expert Barnaby Jack at the Black Hat security conference in 2010, where he demonstrated a "Jackpotting" hack that easily emptied an XP-based ATM machine. According to Botezatu, Jack, who died in 2013, never revealed the nature of this exploit, meaning that it could remain an unpatched vulnerability in XP-based machines.

Be assertive not aggressive, find a middle way between boasting and passivity. The interviewer has only around thirty minutes to decide if you are the person for the job. In this time you need to stress your key strengths and relevant past achievements. At the right moments in the conversation, take the lead and steer the interview in the direction you want. Ask a question about the job and after the interviewer has replied, answer yourself, linking your strengths and achievements. Reflect your qualities back to the job you are applying for. Employers are not so interested that this is a good opportunity for you but, rather, how your competencies are tailor made for their job offer.

Physical movement is not the only way of peering into dreams, though. Researchers can now humanely peer into the electrical and chemical activities of brain cells in animals while they sleep. In 2007, MIT scientists Kenway Louise and Matthew Wilson recorded the activity of neurons in a part of the rat brain called the hippocampus, a structure known to be involved in the formation and encoding of memories. They first recorded the activity of those brain cells while the rats ran in their mazes. Then they looked at the activity of the very same neurons while they slept. Louise and Wilson discovered identical patterns of firing during running and during REM. In other words, it was as if the rats were running the maze in their minds while they were snoozing. The results were so clear that the researchers could infer the rats' precise location within their mental dream mazes and map them to actual spots within the actual maze.

K2 Energy researches lithium-iron phosphate batteries, which can be charged and discharged about twice as many times as lithium-ion without losing their capacity and can withstand the high temperatures that cause the batteries in most electronics to degrade quickly. Lithium-iron can't yet pack as much power into a small space as lithium-ion, but Stoker says the company is seeing rapid improvements. The technology already appears in electric cars, and may soon spill over into consumer devices as well.
K2能源公司正在研究磷酸锂铁电池。这种电池的充放电次数大约是锂离子电池的2倍，没有容量损失，而且还耐高温。要知道高温会让电池指标迅速恶化甚至报废。目前的磷酸锂铁电池还不能做的和锂电池一样小，但斯托克说他们已经取得很大进展。该技术已经应用在电动汽车上，而且将很快渗透到消费电子领域。

If you have any doubt that the studios have the power to dictate uniform retail prices, consider what happened with the introduction of "The Godfather" in 1972. Up to that point, the tradition was that theaters could charge a premium for tickets to the handful of "event" movies that came out every year-- in the modern context, the "Harry Potter" and "Spider-Man" movies. But when "The Godfather" was released in 1972, suddenly every movie theater in the country eliminated its event-movie pricing. That's the kind of "coincidence" Don Vito Corleone would have been proud of.
“如果您对制片厂能够左右票价同一的能力表示怀疑，请仔细回想1972年电影《教父》的发行。在《教父》之前的传统是，影院可以高价发售年年涌现的一堆大片，放到如今即《哈利波特》《蜘蛛侠》之类的影片。但是到1972年《教父》发行时，美国的所有影院突然摒弃了之前的高价策略。此等巧合要片中的老教父科利昂知道了定会颇为得意吧。”

What's the difference? "It helps to keep developing your skills and staying active in your field while you're job hunting," Papas explains. One woman he spoke with "took online courses, earned new certifications, did a couple of unpaid internships, and attended trade group conferences and other networking events, so she had something recent to talk about in job interviews," he says. "If you stay current and involved, and keep your resume up-to-date to reflect that, it's shows employers you're motivated and a self-starter."

All of us who have bosses could benefit by thinking about the origin of our ideas about power. Many of us have set beliefs about how executives and managers behave regardless of how they actually act, according to a 2011 study co-authored by Detert that was published in the Academy of Management Journal. After interviewing 190 people at a tech company, the researchers found that many demonstrated what's called "implicit"-- or non-evidence-based, yet deep-rooted-- beliefs. Those included the idea that voicing an opinion different from the manager's would seem like a challenge to his or her ability, even if employees had seen evidence to the contrary.

Maureen Mahoney, the dean of the college at Smith College, and Barbara Cervone, president of the education non-profit What Kids Can Do both noted that medical problems — particularly lagging dental care or undiagnosed learning disabilities — can cause significant snags for poor students who might already be reeling from the academic culture shock. Cervone remembers one high achieving student from the Dominican Republic who, in her freshman year at Wellesley, found she had several rotting teeth, which couldn't be fixed because the university's health policy wouldn't cover it. After a petition to the college president, the policy changed and the student was able to get the care she needed and continue with her studies. But the situation highlights how proactive students have to be to procure the funds and care they might need.
史密斯学院院长莫林·马奥尼都注意到了医疗的问题——尤其是拖着不治的牙病或未经确诊的学习障碍——可能会对已经受到学院文化冲击而烦恼不已的贫困学生造成更大困扰。切尔沃内还记得一位来自多米尼加共和国的优秀学生，在上韦尔斯利学院的第一年，她就发现自己有几颗蛀牙，而这些蛀牙无法修补，因为这所大学的医保政策并不包括这一项。在向学院院长递交了一份请愿书后，学校修改了医保政策，这名学生得以接受其需要的牙科治疗并继续其学业。但这种情况表明，学生需要多主动才能获得其需要的资金支持和医疗服务。

Moon jumped to nearly a 100 million-chip lead after a 20-minute break, but Cada's fortunes changed when he made one of the more memorable all-in calls in recent World Series of Poker history. Moon aggressively played a board with 10-10-9-5 after the turn to put Cada's entire tournament at risk.

While the Tiguan is smaller than other compact crossovers and offers less cargo space, it also charges a premium for its German technology, so buyers get less for more. A well-equipped model went for $34,000 in 2013, putting Tiguan at a cost disadvantage to others in its segment. Small space and high price haven't turned out to be a winning combination. U.S. News ranked Tiguan 17th against its competitors, well behind the No. 1 Subaru Forester. Wrote MotorTrend in 2012: "While the Tiguan is marketed as a premium alternative to its rivals, the driving experience and included content simply don't live up to those expectations."

Since the collapse of communism, huge variations in long-term growth have appeared in the former Soviet block While Poland’s gross domestic product had doubled by 2013, that of Ukraine remains below its initial level. Institutional change, or the lack of it, is a key to this divergence. Poland and most other former Soviet countries swiftly restructured state machinery to enable the growth of dynamic, politically autonomous private companies in competitive domestic markets. By contrast in Ukraine, as in Russia, crony capitalism took hold. Politically connected businesspeople can use political patronage to take over the assets of less fortunate entrepreneurs while some politicians use their power to enrich themselves.
自从共产主义制度倒台以来，前苏联共和国的长期增长出现巨大差距，到2013年，波兰的GDP翻了一番，而乌克兰仍不及最初水平。体制变革是导致这种差距的关键。波兰和其他多数前苏联共和国迅速改组了国家机器，使得活力十足、政治自主的私营企业在有竞争性的国内市场实现了增长。相比之下，乌克兰就像在俄罗斯那样，裙带资本主义生根发芽。有政治人脉的商人可以利用政治保护伞，夺取不那么幸运的企业家的资产，同时一些政客利用手中的权力发财致富。

Industrial towns across America are experiencing similar trauma, Rosin writes. As the men pine for the golden days, the women push nostalgia aside and take on the provider role. "When men start to flame out, women by necessity have to become self-sufficient, to take care of the kids," says MIT economist David Autor. "They don't marry the men, who are just another mouth to feed."
美国各地的工业城镇都在经历类似的创伤，罗森写道。就在男性为逝去的黄金岁月满怀感伤之际，女性们却将怀旧情绪搁置一旁，担当起养家糊口的角色。“男人逐渐熄火的时候，妇女不得不自食其力，肩负起抚养小孩的责任，”麻省理工学院的经济学家大卫•奥特尔说道。“她们不愿嫁人，因为所谓的丈夫仅仅是另一张需要喂养的嘴而已。”

But luxury doesn't have to cost a small fortune. Ms. Eisen first found the 'Ugly Betty' chairs, as she calls them, on a secondhand furniture website. She bought two of the chairs for under $100 each two years ago, she said, to furnish a triplex apartment on West 23rd Street. The unit sold for $8.2 million shortly after the staging. After that, one of the chairs made its way to Central Park West, where it stands handsomely near the fireplace in the nearly $12 million listing of late actress Celeste Holm. Its twin is currently in the $8 million penthouse at 1212 Fifth Ave., the same building in which it helped sell another unit listed for $6.2 million in November.

The bottom quarter of earners with a college degree don't make more money than the average high school graduate. And this hasn't really changed much in 40 years.

Of course, over the past 40 years, the cost of a degreehas increased 12-fold, while a degree holder isn't making more money at all, when accounting for inflation.

Then my father sat down beside him, put his arm around my brother's shoulder, and said, 'Bird by bird, buddy. Just take it bird by bird.'"

Given the poor quality of Chinese economic data, it's more difficult to measure how much Chinese firms invest directly in Africa through building infrastructure or purchasing assets, but a U.S. Government Accountability Office report from last year estimated that U.S. firms still lead their Chinese counterparts in this kind of investment, but just barely. The U.S. only invested 23% more than China in Sub-Saharan Africa from 2007 through 2011, and the GAO suspects that even its approximation might be underestimating Chinese investment in the continent.

Shill dates back to 1914 and is thought to be a shortened form of the earlier term shillaber. Its original use was to describe a person who acted as a swindler's accomplice by reacting in an enthusiastic way in order to encourage others, often as an audience member at a carnival in order to elicit interest in an attraction. Over time the word began to be applied in a variety of contexts. For example in marketing, a shill is a person who gives the impression that they are a satisfied independent customer of someone they're in fact secretly working for.
Shill一词可追溯到1914年，基本都认为是shillaber一词的简写形式。该词最初指在狂欢节等场合为了吸引人们注意而配合骗子积极对其表演做出回应的同伙。后来，这个词逐渐用于不同的语境。比如，在市场营销中，shill指受商贩雇佣，假装成顾客给其好评的“托儿”。

Most of what we heard during the 40 months the Volcker Rule was being written by the regulators came from the incredibly effective Wall Street lobbying machine. Articles appeared in all of the major financial publications saying the Volcker Rule would destroy banking as we know it. The underlying arguments were always that Wall Street wasn't really responsible for the financial meltdown, that if there had been some minor problems the banks had already fixed them, and therefore no major structural changes were needed. The regulators were hearing the same things — in spades. A study by Duke Law Professor Kim Krawiec demonstrated how lopsided the lobbying on the Volcker Rule was. She found that, between July 26, 2010 and July 7, 2011, 93.6 percent of the meetings with commissioners and staff of the five regulators charged with writing the rule were with financial institutions, law firms representing financial institutions, or financial institution trade associations, lobbyists, or policy advisors. Only 3.2 percent represented labor or public interest groups; another 3.2 percent came from congressional staff members.
在监管机构编写沃尔克规则的40个月期间，我们听到的大部分传言来自华尔街非常高效的游说机器。出现在所有主要金融刊物上的文章都表示，沃尔克规则将会破坏我们所知道的银行业务。其根本理由始终是：实际上华尔街并不是造成金融危机的原因，如果存在一些小问题的话，那么各大银行也已经解决了这些问题，因此不需要进行任何重大的结构性改革。相关监管机构肯定也听到了同样的声音。杜克大学法学教授金·克拉维茨进行的一项研究结果表明，针对沃尔克规则展开的游说活动是多么一边倒。她发现，在2010年7月26日至2011年7月7日期间，与负责编写该项规则的各相关委员会和五家监管机构的工作人员进行会谈的另一方有93.6％是金融机构、代表金融机构的律师事务所、金融机构行业协会、游说者或者政策顾问。只有3.2％代表劳动者或公共利益团体，还有3.2％来自国会工作人员。

Both sides gain from this arrangement, says Robert Hecker, director of the Singapore office of Horwath HTL, a global consultancy serving the hospitality industry. 'Any time you can get some of your development costs up-front, that's a huge benefit.'

If you don't remember what they are, here's a list and primer. When overused, prepositions can weaken writing and contribute to wordiness. For example: "The meeting on December 1 about the budget" is sharper when written "The December 1 budget meeting." Also watch out for prepositions following a verb, such as" come up with "or" find out. "Instead, you could use" generate "or" determine, "respectively.
如果你不记得了，下面是一些简单的例子。如果过度使用介词，会降低写作质量，造成冗余。比如：“关于预算的会议在12月1日召开”就没有“12月1日开预算会议”来的简洁有力。动词后面的介词也需要特别留意。比如“come up with”，你就可以分别用“generate”和“determine”代替。

Don't be afraid to say no to expansion opportunities. Decide what key success factor a new location must meet-- whether that's foot traffic or drive-by traffic or the presence of a cluster of similar stores--and if you're not going to be able to satisfy those criteria, don't go there. Consider Southwest Airlines as an example. One reason they're so successful is that they've said no to expansion opportunities if there wasn't enough demand on a particular route to make it worthwhile.

While 12 of 30 National Hockey League teams operated at a loss or close to it during the 2012-13 season, according to FORBES estimates, the Jets are basking in a turnaround, thanks to a timely move from Atlanta to hockey-mad Winnipeg after a 15-year absence of the sport from the city. In the first year following the 2011 relocation Jets revenues shot up 48% to $105 million with operating profit of $13.3 million – despite relocating to a 700, 000-person metro roughly one-eighth the size of Atlanta.

This is in stark contrast with the sort of rhetoric that the president himself has used, as he has often talked about the need to "win the future" by out-educating, out-innovating, and out-competing the Indians and the Chinese. And it's not just the Obama Administration that likes to paint China as a competitor rather than a collaborator, as American politicians tend to describe the world in stark, competitive terms during election season and during high profile events like the State of the Union. But the president appears to understand that the world is a bit more complicated than an economic football game. The above quote suggests that he believes that African economic development would be good for America even if it's not American firms doing the development, as a vibrant Africa could be an excellent destination for American exports.
与之产生鲜明对比的是，奥巴马在经常谈到需要“通过在教育、创新和竞争方面赶超印度人和中国人来赢得未来”时的言辞。不只是奥巴马政府喜欢将中国描绘为竞争者而非协作者、在竞选季和国情咨文等备受关注的活动中，美国政客都倾向于以毫不掩饰的竞争性词语来描述这个世界。但奥巴马看起来明白一点：这世界要比一场经济足球赛复杂不少。前述讲话表明，他相信非洲经济的发展有利于美国，即便不是美国公司在做这些开发，经济充满活力的非洲将成为极好的美国出口市场。

No company that falls behind the competition is guilty of standing completely still. But sometimes our efforts fail because of the level of commitment to change. "I'll try" can become a half-hearted promise of follow-through rather than decisive action. Stanford d. school academic director Bernie Roth demonstrates this idea with a brief exercise that his students say delivers a lasting message. He holds out a water bottle and asks them to try to take it from him. Facing grey-haired Bernie, a 50-year veteran of the Stanford Design Program, students usually hesitate as they try to grab it from him. Their initial efforts yield nothing. His grasp just grows more ironclad as the strapping 20-year-olds and powerful CEOs try to wrestle the bottle away from the octogenarian.

In another case, a neighbor planted trees in 2006 that blocked part of Merton Lawwill's panoramic view of San Francisco Bay from his four-bedroom, 3 1 / 2-bathroom house in Tiburon, Calif. As Mr. Lawwill went through arbitration and a lawsuit to get the neighbor to move the trees, appraiser Curt Thor of North Bay Real Estate Appraisals calculated that the view blockage had sapped 17% to 20% of the value from Mr. Lawwill's $2.6 million home. The case was settled in 2009, with the neighbor agreeing to move some trees elsewhere and trim others, both sides say. 'So I spent $200, 000 [in legal costs] to keep my view,' Mr. Lawwill said. 'It was three years of agony.'

But inborn beauty isn't always lucrative. One 2006 study showed that the unbecoming may actually profit from their lack of looks. People tend to expect less from the unattractive, so when they surpass those low expectations they are rewarded. And the pulchritudinous are often initially held to a higher standard — then hit with a "beauty penalty" if they fail to deliver. "You might see this as wages being depressed over time," says Rick K. Wilson, a Rice University political scientist who co-authored the study. "We have these really high expectations for attractive people. By golly, they don't often live up to our expectations."
但天生的美丽也不总是有利的。一份2006年的研究显示，长相欠佳的人实际上可能会从外貌缺陷中受益。对于没什么吸引力的人，人们的期望往往也要少，所以如果他们超出了这种低期望，就会得到奖励。而且漂亮的人经常从一开始就被要求达到更高的标准，如果失败了，就会受到“美丽的惩罚”。共同参与研究的莱斯大学的政治学家Rick K. Wilson说：“你能见到这种情况的实例，比如随着时间增长工资却变低了。我们对有魅力的人确实有相当高的期望。天哪，他们经常让我们的期望落空。”

ON JUNE 6th François Hollande, France's new president, unveiled plans to reverse a planned rise in the official retirement age to 62. In most other countries the trend is in the other direction. According to a new report from the OECD, increases in the official retirement age are planned or underway in 28 out of its 34 member countries. As can be seen from the chart below, pensionable ages have failed to keep pace with longevity. This comes at an increasing cost to the state. The OECD expects governments' expenditure on pensions to rise from 8.4% to 11.4% of GDP between 2010 and 2050. And in most countries people retire earlier than the official retirement age. In 1970 the average Frenchman entering retirement could expect to live for just over ten years. Now he could expect to live for 23.
法国新任总统弗朗索瓦奥朗德在6月6日将他的计划公之于众，而此计划则与当前把法定退休年龄升至62岁的计划背道而驰。在大多数其它国家，这种趋势与他的提议是相反的。根据来自经济合作与发展组织的一篇新报道显示，该组织34个成员国中就有28个已经计划或是正在筹备着将本国的法定退休年龄升高。从以下的图表可以看出，领取养老金的年龄已赶不上人们的寿命了。该调查源自一个生活成本不断增加的国家。经济合作与发展组织期望政府对养老金的投入在2010年到2050年间能从占到国内生产总值的8.9%升至11.4%。而且在大多数的国家，人们的实际退休年龄总是要比本国的法定退休年龄要早。在1970年进入退休年龄的法国人希望可以再活10年，而现在他们的目标是再多活23年。

In Miami, Jason Atkins, founder and CEO of Tui Lifestyles, buys furniture in bulk at wholesale prices. Unlike some competitors, Tui Lifestyles only sells its furniture instead of leasing it. Most pieces are used for staging, but consumers can buy directly from the company as well. The average invoice for a complete staging ranges from $23, 000 to $32, 000. One recent project includes a 1, 128-square-foot unit in Miami's Paramount Bay, which sold for $758, 000-- one of the highest prices per square foot in the building. The listing agent then sold the furnishings to the buyer for over $90, 000, Mr. Atkins said.

As the show's curator and head of the Asian art department, Maxwell K. Hearn, takes pains to explain, we could just as fruitfully look at these works in the context of global contemporary art, and indeed many a name is familiar from that world. But by showcasing them in the Chinese galleries-- a first for the Met-- rather than in the modern and contemporary wing, Mr. Hearn invites us to look at the works through the lens of Chinese history. And a powerful lens this proves to be.
在展览总监、亚洲艺术部部长何慕文(Maxwell K. Hearn)辛苦讲解之际，我们把这些作品放到世界当代艺术的背景下去看，同样会收获良多，事实上展览中的很多名字在世界当代艺术圈里都耳熟能详。然而把这些作品放在中国展区而不是放在现当代展区，何慕文是在邀请我们透过中国历史的镜头来观看它们。事实证明这是一支强大的镜头。

Big cities have an even bigger edge in true superstars, players who are All-Stars year after year. Since 1976, players making repeat appearances have taken nine of 10 All-Star spots. Sixty percent of spots have gone to the 65 players who have played in five or more All-Star games. And the dozen players who have played in 10 or more All-Star games account for roughly 30 percent of all slots. Los Angeles leads in the number of repeat All-Star slots with 69, followed by Boston with 61. Detroit has 48, Phoenix 47, Philadelphia 46, and New York and San Antonio 43.
大城市对于真正的超级明星来说有着更广阔的边界。自1976 年以来，反复出现的球员已占据了全明星城市的十分之九。百分之六十的城市划分给了进入全明星赛5 次或更多次的65 个球员。有一打已经入选10 次或更多次全明星赛的球员占据了大概所有城市的30%。洛杉矶以69 次在反复出现在全明星赛的城市中排名第一，随后是61 次出现的波士顿。底特律出现48 次，菲尼克斯出现47 次，费城出现46 次，纽约和圣安东尼奥出现43 次。

Alas for ambitious school leavers, universities cannot expand to accommodate them. That fact, as well as the cap on tuition fees, albeit at a higher level, has stymyied the development of a higher-education market. Because the Treasury must lend students the funds to pay their fees and because not all graduates clear their debts, the state limits not only how much universities charge but also how many students they can admit. During the boom years, adding places was affordable. Now it is not. A temporary expansion of places in England announced in 2010 is about to end. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where devolved administrations keep fees down for local and EU students, expansion is equally unaffordable.

The exigencies of the Great War blew away these fiscal inhibitions. After the war politicians never fully lost their taste for the intoxicating and enormous powers the war had given them, nor did they forget how easily the government could seize a nation's financial assets through taxation, inflation and capital controls. The Depression broke away any remaining restraints, as Keynes and others successfully propagated a new mercantilism – a medieval ideology that had governments playing a suffocating role, regulating economic life in the name of increasing a nation's wealth. Mercantilism was a failure, as the contrast between nations such as Holland, Britain and then the newly minted U.S. that had shed its stifling strictures and those that continued to adhere to them avidly demonstrated. But as happens in monster movies, the beast slithered back from the swamps. Neomercantilists enticingly promised that economies could achieve smooth, balanced and perpetual growth, with full employment, by scientifically manipulating government spending and money creation. Free markets were inherently unstable, they warned, pointing to the Depression. The fact that governments have caused every major economic disaster – including the Depression – was ignored. Spending stimulates growth, said these new conjurers, rather than wastefully taking away resources from the private sector, thereby hurting investment and economic expansion. Politicians loved that message. Their instinctive bad habit of shoveling out money to buy votes and power was now a virtue, an engine of progress.
第一次世界大战的紧急情况吹散了这些财政约束。一战结束后，对于战争所赋予的那种令人陶醉且巨大无边的权力，政客们始终无法完全割舍对它的迷恋，他们也没有忘记，通过税收、通胀和资本管制，政府可以何等轻易地夺取一国的金融资产。上世纪三十年代的全球经济大萧条爆发让各国摆脱了所有残余的约束，因为凯恩斯等人成功传播了一种新的重商主义——重商主义是中世纪的一种思想体系，它要求政府发挥极度干预的作用，并且以提高国家财富的名义控制经济生活。荷兰、英国以及新崛起的美国等已抛弃重商主义令人窒息的约束的国家，与那些热衷于坚守此道的国家形成了鲜明对比，并因此证明重商主义是失败的。但正如在怪物电影中所发生的那样，这个怪物又从沼泽中爬了回来。新重商主义者极具诱惑地承诺，通过合乎科学地操控政府开支和货币创造，经济可以在充分就业的情况下实现平稳、平衡而且永续的增长。他们警告说，自由市场本质上是不稳定的，他们以三十年代大萧条为例对此加以证明。但每一场重大经济灾难都是由政府造成这个事实却被忽略了。这些新巫师表示，消费可以刺激经济增长，而不是浪费地夺走私营部门的资源——从而对投资和经济扩张造成损害。政客们喜欢这个启示。他们与生俱来通过加大开支来收买选票和权力的坏习惯现在成为一种美德，成为进步的一个推动力。

Put in your time – not for your own betterment, but for the team's betterment. Be dependable and follow through for your team. Make it your goal to show up for something bigger than you.
坚韧是努力工作，无需认可。聚丽首席执行官珍妮•帕克是我的朋友，她曾跟我谈起她和同行们发现的一个问题，就是年轻雇员在工作中存在一个共性，他们工作是为自己能崭露头角，而并不是为了整个团队。你想变成坚韧的人吗？努力让整个团队进步，而不仅仅是为了你个人。依靠你的团队，为你的团队坚持到底。以此为目标，超越一己私利的局限。

According to Martin Freeman, the actor who portrays Watson in Sherlock, Watson is not just a sidekick, but also an “equal partner”, a “trustworthy companion”. Freeman describes Watson as “Sherlock’s eyes on the world, but also the world’s eyes on Sherlock, everything is filtered through John.” A review in The Daily Telegraph reads that “Watson provides many of the shows’ lighter moments, and is a more emotive soul relative to Cumberbatch’s often cold and detached Holmes.”

Worse yet, sometimes there is no chance for a first impression. People are relying more and more on online reviews, and as a result, companies or products with low reviews or simply not a large total of reviews don't get business.

But what happens to new restaurants that haven't been reviewed much yet, or restaurants that hire a new chef and up their game? Sometimes, there's more to reality than what Google can tell you.

But I also struggled with the fact that I loved Jon Cryer's Duckie, too-- that his adoration for Andie seemed so simple and easy and loyal in comparison. Is it OK to pick the Blanes of the world over the Duckies? I think sometimes it is, especially when you are young and still learning about yourself and relationships. Inevitably, people are going to like my children that my children might not like back in the the same way, and vice versa. The trick, then, is to teach my children to treat people with respect and care, even if they can't return the same level of feeling. After all, you can't love someone back out of obligation. That's not the way it works.

The case of Donna Kilgore was the first widely publicised success of MDMA in treating a psychiatric condition. In 1993, she was raped by a stranger who burst into her home in Alaska. Her cries alerted the police who caught the rapist. After the attack, Kilgore tried to get on with her life, which was made easier by the fact that she could not remember much of her experience. After four years, she began having flashbacks, panic attacks, fits of anger, migraines and faints. She consulted a series of psychiatrists who prescribed a series of drugs. Some of the drugs dulled the pain, others exacerbated it. Finally, in 2002, a new psychiatrist linked her condition to her rape for the first time, diagnosed her with PTSD, and sent her to Dr Michael Mithoefer in South Carolina. Mithoefer was one of many therapists who were convinced that MDMA could play a major role in curing patients of a range of psychiatric disorders, including PTSD. He was licensed to carry out experiments with MDMA and Kilgore was his first patient.

There are a variety of processes for 3-D printing. Some of the most widely used rely on a printer that makes objects from powdered material. A 3-D printer bears little resemblance to a document printer in an office. It has two major parts: a 'build box' that contains a smooth, thin bed of finely ground material such as pulverized stainless steel or powdered plastic; and a printing head. Depending on the type of printer, the head contains either a heat source, such as a laser or an electron beam, that melts the powdered material or jets that spray binder over the powder in a precise pattern. The binder functions as a glue for the material as an object is built.
3-D打印的类型多种多样，其中应用最广泛的是能够将粉末材料塑形的打印机。相比办公室里的文档打印机，两者几乎没有任何相似之处。3-D打印机主要有两个部分：一个装有光滑粉末微粒材料的“铸模托盘”(Build Box)和一个打印头。根据打印机型号的不同，打印头会包含一个热源或者几个喷射口。热源分为激光头或电子束，能够熔化粉末材料；喷射口则以一种精准模式向粉末材料喷射凝胶剂。在这个物体的成型过程中，凝胶剂能够像胶水一样粘合粉末材料。

The people's trust in their government is undermined by congressional earmarks -- special interest projects that are often snuck in at the last minute, without discussion or debate. Last year, I asked you to voluntarily cut the number and cost of earmarks in half. I also asked you to stop slipping earmarks into committee reports that never even come to a vote. Unfortunately, neither goal was met. So this time, if you send me an appropriations bill that does not cut the number and cost of earmarks in half, I will send it back to you with my veto. And tomorrow, I will issue an Executive Order that directs Federal agencies to ignore any future earmark that is not voted on by the Congress. If these items are truly worth funding, the Congress should debate them in the open and hold a public vote.

When I first saw E. T.in the movie theater, I cried hard when he had to leave Elliott. That kind of separation, that permanency of loss was not something I was prepared to handle yet.

Creating original programming will only help bind kids to Netflix.

From the bus station in Jingmen, we jumped into one final taxi, which would take me to the school where my new apartment was. Once again, Mr. Li sat in the front, while I sat in the back with my bags. Even though it was October, the weather was much warmer here than it was back home. With the windows rolled down, I felt the cool wind dry the dampness from my hair and face. I let out a quiet sigh, knowing that I was almost there. Over thirty hours of traveling, all in two days, was about to come to an end. I finally felt that the stressful ordeal of traveling from one country to another was almost over and even though I also knew that soon I would be confronted with the new stresses of finding my way around a city where I did not speak the language and later still I would find myself in front of a classroom for the first time, for now, I could be at peace. And as I sat there, with the strange new sounds and smells of a strange new city carried by the cool breeze across my smiling face, I heard what sounded like a deep hacking from Mr. Li. I opened my eyes just in time to see him spit out the window. I watched as the glob of yellowish liquid flew out his window, got caught by the wind, and was then thrown back into the car through my window, to land with a splatter across my forehead. I wiped the spittle from my face and smiled. I was home.

The time has come for a Holy Land where a democratic Israel and a democratic Palestine live side-by-side in peace.

The Nelsons did not stumble upon this business boon completely by chance. Both Charles and Candace come from a background in investment banking in San Francisco. Before opening a cupcake bakery out of their home kitchen, the couple worked on initial public offerings with technology companies. Then they moved down to Los Angeles in 2003 with the idea of starting a cupcake-only bakery. At first, Candace and Charles couldn't get anyone to lease them a space because the idea of a bakery that only sold cupcakes was too "kooky," says Charles. Next thing they knew, celebrities like Tyra Banks and Henry Winkler were placing orders, and the business took off from there. The company is even partnering with a Middle Eastern franchise operator to open 34 new locations abroad.

"It's not so hard to predict the future, but it's sometimes hard to connect the dots." In the opening of his lecture to the Global Futures 2045 Congress, famed geneticist Dr. George Church neatly summed up what being a futurist is all about, though he was reminding the audience rather than the other speakers assembled at Alice Tully Hall in New York City this past weekend. Gathered there by a young Russian tech tycoon on a mission to do nothing less than achieve immortality through technology, a who's-who of renowned technologists, scientists, futurists, and entrepreneurs painted a sometimes terrifying, sometimes electrifying picture of what the world is going to look like in the decades to come, describing how technology is going to drastically alter economies, biologies, and perhaps even consciousness itself.

You'll meet a lot of people who, to put it simply, don't know what they're talking about.

By 1980, every show on television was about a divorced Jew who lives in New York City and goes on a blind date with Tom Selleck.

Similarly, Li Huasheng's 9-foot scrolls subvert the way we appreciate line in Chinese painting. Rather than the element that reveals the artist's individual energy, or qi, his lines-- evenly executed horizontals and verticals-- embody pure concentration devoid of personality. It is man in the service of ink-- or perhaps this thought arises because Mr. Li's work hangs near abstract works in which the ink seizes control. In the 1994 '100 Layers of Ink,' for example, Mr. Yang's gestures are lost beneath an accumulation of ink so thick it pulls the paper into crests and ripples.
同样，李华生九英尺高的卷轴也颠覆了我们对中国画线条的理解。他的线条体现的不是揭示艺术家个人精神的“气”，而是不含个人色彩的纯粹专注。人为墨服务──之所以有这种想法，可能也是因为李华生的作品被悬挂在了抽象作品附近，在这些作品中，墨汁掌握了控制权。比如在1994年的《千层墨》里，杨诘苍的态度就被掩盖在厚厚的墨汁之下。墨汁是如此之厚，把纸张都吸出了突起和褶皱。

Moreover, these women tend to have unrealistic notions about their economic paths. Young, middle-class women often fail to save because they assume - still - that marriage will rescue them financially. As a result, they often see buying trendy shoes or a great haircut - rather than giving some money each month to a broker - as an "investment" in their romantic futures.

China especially is now stepping up to the plate. Friedmann says the country wants to employ CCUS technology because its leaders, many of whom are engineers and are aware of the science of climate change, now recognize its importance. "The debate over whether to do CCUS is done," he says. "The debate now is about costs and timing."
美国能源部化石能源办公室清洁燃煤助理副部长胡里奥•弗里德曼表示，全球在开发CCUS技术上共投入45亿美元，其中美国能源部就投入了4亿美元的研发费用。中国现在开始加快了行动。弗里德曼称，中国之所以想采用CCUS，主要是因为中国现任领导人很多都是工程师出身，对气候变化相关科学十分关注，现在也开始意识到这项技术的重要性。他说：“关于是否要采纳CCUS的争论已告一段落，现在争议的焦点是成本问题和推行的时机。”

My life in one word is easy — blessed. My life in 150 words is a little harder. Here are some words from the beginning; poor, afraid, abused, hungry, but that was only part of it. Mix in laughter, love, family, and adventure and the picture becomes a little clearer. Words have always played a big part in my life. Reading was my escape, writing my reprieve. School was my refuge. Fast forward twenty years and I still love words, family is even more important, but those first words have changed to happy, joyous, strong, and hopeful. Now I'm saved, set free, in love with Tommy and with life. Jacob is growing and Shelby and Haley soon became our daughters. Life isn't perfect, it's not supposed to be, but the love of God is and that is enough. Never give up; your words can change too

Some parents in that study would read the instruction not to give the medications to children younger than 4 and simply make up their own dose. They often extrapolated from doses recommended for older children, said Sarah G. Lazarus, a pediatrician at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta who was the lead author. She suggests the medications' age warnings, often found only in small print, may not be prominent enough on the packaging.

There are other new technologies on the horizon, too. Lithium-imide and aluminum-ion batteries promise anywhere from 10 percent to 50 percent more energy in the same amount of space as a lithium-ion battery, longer overall battery life, faster charging, and better reaction to heat. And some can be created with the same equipment as lithium-ion batteries, which means that, in theory, they'll cost about the same.

Another big caveat is the age issue – the coffee-death relationship was only true for people under 55 – and the reason behind this is somewhat of a mystery. It could be that people who are dying this young are already predisposed to fatal health problems in various ways, although this is somewhat speculative. Study author Chip Lavie points out that heavy coffee drinkers differ in a number of ways from less avid consumers, so there may be other, as-yet-undiscovered things going on. The authors suggest that since heart disease wasn't increased among heavy coffee drinkers, but rather death from all causes, cancer may be a culprit. "Certainly, one would think that the main non-CV cause of death would be cancer, but we did not specifically assess this. And with cancer, one would really want to know cause-specific as opposed to cancer in general – we will probably try to assess this, although this is not quite as easy as one may think."
另一个值得注意的是年龄问题。过量饮用咖啡与死亡率升高之间的关联似乎仅发生在年龄55岁以下的人群中，而其背后的原因在某种程度上也是一个谜。这些英年早逝的人或许在此前就因为各种原因存在致命的健康问题，虽然这也只是一种猜测。研究者奇普•李维指出，过量饮用咖啡的人与不那么爱喝咖啡的人，在许多方面都存在着差异，因此，这背后或许有别的未被发现的因素在起作用。研究者称，在过量饮用咖啡的人群中，心脏病的发病比例并未上升，而在各种死因之中，癌症可能是首要原因。“很明显，人们会据此认为，癌症是非心血管疾病死亡的罪魁祸首，但是我们并没有针对此做过专门的评估。对于癌症，人们也总是想知道特定原因的死亡率相对于癌症总体死亡率的情况。我们也许会尝试去做这样的评估，但这却并不像人们想得那么简单。”

Tim Maurer, vice president of Financial Consulate in Hunt Valley Md., and co-author of The Ultimate Financial Plan: Balancing Your Money and Life, agrees. "The biggest financial hurdle faced by minimum-wage earners is avoiding debt," says Maurer. "The first line of defense against consumer debt is margin, often in the form of personal savings, sometimes referred to as emergency reserves. Because there is often so little margin in the minimum-wage earner's paycheck, it's especially difficult to avoid debt when emergencies or perceived emergencies are presented."
蒂姆‧毛瑞尔: Balancing Your Money and Life）的合著者，他也同意以上观点。“赚取最低工资的人面临的最大的金融障碍就是避免欠债，”毛瑞尔说。“抵御消费债务的第一道防线就是余裕，通常是以个人储蓄的形式，有时也叫作应急储备金。因为赚取最低工资的人的薪资支票上，通常只有很少的余裕，如果紧急情况或者感知到的紧急情况出现了的话，想要避免欠债，就极其困难了。”

One important example concerns cookstoves. The black carbon emitted from dirty cookstoves — on which millions of poor people cook — is detrimental to the health of millions of people. The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves is creating a market for low-emissions cookstoves, to help reduce the damaging health and environmental impacts of black carbon. It's an economic empowerment issue because selling and maintaining cookstoves is a new green industry, especially for women. Cooking is not the major contributor to climate change, but low-emissions cookstoves can address one aspect of it.

But Lagarde is also being watched – as a potent female watershed. Never before has a woman held such a powerful position in global finance; the world of money has hitherto been dominated by men, not just inside banks but in bureaucracies too. Lagarde herself has often lamented this pattern, joking, for example, that the financial crisis might have been different if there had been "Lehman Sisters" and pointing out that the euro's" fragile" foundations were created by its" founding fathers", not mothers, since "regrettably, there was no woman at the table at the time." Or, as she recently told me on the telephone: "I wish that there were more women in finance – I think it would be much healthier. We don't know if it would have been different with more women [in 2008] but my intuition tells me it possibly might have been."
不过，拉加德身上还寄托着人们的另一份期待——成为女性证明自己能力的一道分水岭。在全球金融界，女性从未担任过如此高的职务；此前金融界一直为男性所主导，不仅在各银行内部是这样，在官僚机构内亦然。拉加德自己就常常感叹于这种格局，比如，她曾开玩笑说：当初如果有“雷曼姐妹”在，金融危机的走势或许会相当不同；她还指出，“可惜欧元创立时没有女性参与”，所以欧元只有爹、没有妈，先天的底子就没打好。拉加德最近与我通电话时还说：“我希望金融界有更多女性——我认为这会让金融界健康得多。如果金融界有更多的女性，不知道情况会不会不同，但我的直觉告诉我，或许会的。”

The launch of Apple Television grows closer. "While the concept of Apple introducing an actual television is nothing new, most buy side investors are mixed [on whether] the television is a reality," he writes. "Given this skepticism, we believe Apple launching a Television will be a catalyst for shares. Our confidence that the Apple Television is real is primarily based on our checks with component suppliers, as well as Steve Jobs' biography, and Tim Cook's comments on the June conference. We expect Apple could launch the TV in mid to late 2013 and continue to believe the company will announce the TV ~ 6 months ahead of launch to freeze the market." He thinks the TV will sell for $1, 500-$2, 000 at retail and could add 4-8% to calendar 2013 revenues.

This means that 2C targets, or even more ambitious targets, can remain on the table in international climate negotiations."

Some of the demand for flexible furniture originates with consumers becoming accustomed to phones that also function as televisions, and from music players that double as remote controls, says William Harris, one of four principals at the New York-based AvroKo, an architectural firm that specializes in custom, high-design projects.

The study, which was conducted by two professors at University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, looked at 1500 companies and the marital status of the companies' CEOs. The professors found a real difference in the behavior of companies run by CEOs who are single and those run by married top executives. The companies with an unmarried CEO tended to spend more money on things like RD, acquisitions and other investments that could more rapidly increase the size of their businesses, but also had a higher chance of blowing up. The result was a more volatile stock price.

This phenomenon's occurrence in many species makes evolutionary sense. For 99% of animals, stress involves a major burst of energy use as they, say, run for their lives. Afterward, the body stimulates appetite, especially for high-density calories, to rebuild depleted energy stores. But we smart, neurotic humans keep turning the stress-response on for purely psychological reasons, putting our bodies repeatedly into the restocking mode.

This is of course not really how things would work. Even during the financial crisis most firms didn't lose money trading every single day. Wall Street analysts have long taken these estimates of how much a firm's trading desk could lose with a grain of salt.

Steel yourself for the results of a new study that's making headlines: Those of us under 55 who drink a lot of coffee – more than four cups per day – may be at greater risk of an early death. And not death from heart problems, but death from all causes. The study, from Mayo Clinic Proceedings, followed people for almost two decades, and found that in both sexes, younger people were more likely to die of anything than people who drank less. Though it may sound bleak, the study really just adds to the mishmosh of coffee studies all pointing at different outcomes. And good news remains – many earlier studies have found that heavy coffee consumption is linked to reduced mortality. So the logical advice is still to enjoy your daily ritual if it seems to work for you.
最近，有一项新的研究结论引起了媒体的广泛报道。在看这个结论之前，请先做好思想准备：研究表明，每天过量饮用咖啡，具体来说是每天喝超过4杯咖啡，将会导致年龄55岁以下人群的早逝风险增加，而且死亡原因并非是心脏问题，而是由各种因素导致。这份刊登在《梅奥诊所学报》，相比那些较少饮用咖啡的人，过量饮用咖啡者的死亡风险要更高。这项研究的结论听起来让人沮丧，但是此前有关咖啡的众多研究得出了各不相同的结论，这一报告使结论更加纷杂。而且，好消息仍然存在，许多早期的研究表明，大量饮用咖啡与减小死亡率有关。在这样的情况下，合乎逻辑的建议是，如果你觉得饮用咖啡对你有好处，你仍然可以每天享用。

Volkswagen AG is nothing if not an engineering powerhouse, its various brands embodying traits from Porsche's performance to VW's fuel economy to Bugatti's voluptuous and curvy exteriors. The mastermind of this expertise, Prof. Dr. Hackenberg, as he is called, is the head of the automaker's research and development. He is credited with developing a new approach to design and manufacturing that optimizes variation among models from a particular platform, all of which share characteristics that allow them to be built from common parts and components. The money saved by this method, VW claims, gives it the option to equip its cars with extra features and content or to reduce price while maintaining profitability.

Itchy, flaky skin can be an irritating and unsightly consequence of cold, dry air. But should you just write it off as a winter annoyance? No, says Dr. Jaliman. Dry skin, if not kept at bay, can be a portal for infection. "It's very important to keep dry skin hydrated," she says. When skin becomes dry, it can lead to small cracks that can leave your body prone to infections. To prevent this, moisturize twice daily — after you shower and before bed — as well as throughout the day for body parts that are prone to dryness, like your hands. "I like Aquaphor," says Dr. Jaliman. "It's inexpensive and effective."
误区9：皮肤干燥只是冬季的一种无害的烦恼。痒啊！寒冷、干燥的空气产生的后果就是脱皮的刺激瘙痒和难看皮肤。但这只是冬天的一个烦恼吗？不，Jaliman医生说。干性皮肤，如果不能保持湿润，会发生感染。“对干性皮肤来说，保持其中的水分是非常重要的，”她说。当皮肤变得干燥，就会发生细小皲裂，成为机体感染的门户。为了防止这种情况，每天滋润二次，如晨起淋浴和晚上就寝前。白天，则对那些容易发生皮肤干燥皲裂的部位，如双手，经常擦保湿护肤品。“我喜欢AQUAPHOR，”Jaliman医生说：“这东西又便宜又有效。”

Loneliness, says John T. Cacioppo, an award-winning psychologist at the University of Chicago, undermines people's ability to self-regulate. In one experiment he cites, participants made to feel socially disconnected ate many more cookies than those made to feel socially accepted. In a real-life study of middle-aged and older adults in the Chicago area, Dr. Cacioppo and colleagues found that those who scored high on the U. C.L. A. Loneliness Scale, a widely used psychological assessment, ate substantially more fatty foods than those who scored low. "Is it any wonder that we turn to ice cream or other fatty foods when we're sitting at home feeling all alone in the world?" Dr. Cacioppo said in his well-documented book, "Loneliness," written with William Patrick. "We want to soothe the pain we feel by mainlining sugar and fat content to the pleasure centers of the brain, and absent of self-control, we go right at it."
据芝加哥大学(University of Chicago)获奖无数的心理学家约翰·T ·卡奇奥波(John T. Cacioppo)说，孤独感会影响人们的自我调节能力。他援引了一项试验：感觉自己与社会脱节的参试者，相比觉得受社会接纳的参试者，所吃的饼干要更多。卡奇奥波曾和同事们在芝加哥地区做过一项研究，参加试验的是中老年人，他们发现那些在加州大学洛杉矶分校孤独感量表中得分较高的人，比起得分低者，所吃的高脂食物要多得多。卡奇奥波与威廉·派特里克(William Patrick)合著有内容翔实的著作——《孤独感》，在书中他写道：“坐在家中，感觉自己与世隔绝，在这种时候狂吃冰激淋或其他高脂食物，这有什么好奇怪的？我们希望通过将糖和脂肪注入大脑的愉悦中枢来纾解心中的苦闷，在此时我们毫无自制力，直接将手伸向食物。”

Politicians now try to present themselves not as saviours but as managers: Romney, Mario Monti and even Hollande. That's no wonder, as since 1945 the managerialism of Dwight Eisenhower or Bill Clinton has fared rather better than the utopianism of, say, Pol Pot. As George Orwell wrote in 1943: "Plans for human betterment do normally come unstuck, and the pessimist has many more opportunities of saying 'I told you so' than the optimist." In Ukraine last month, a liberal dissident mused to me about who might be the country's ideal leader, everyone else having failed. He came up with Lee Kuan Yew or General Franco. Progress has vanished not just from politics but from public life generally: the British municipal libraries that once stood for progress are now being closed.
政客们现在试图把自己定位成经理人，而非救世主：罗姆尼、马里奥•蒙蒂(Mario Monti)甚至奥朗德都是如此。这并不奇怪，因为自1945年以来，德怀特•艾森豪威尔(Dwight Eisenhower)或比尔•克林顿(Bill Clinton)的管理主义风格表现远好于红色高棉领导人波尔布特(Pol Pot)的乌托邦主义。正如乔治•奥威尔(George Orwell)在1943年所写的那样：“旨在推动人类进步的计划确实往往以失败告终，悲观主义者比乐观主义者更有机会说‘我早就告诉你会这样’。”上月在乌克兰，一位自由派异见人士跟我说起谁也许是该国理想的领导人，因为其他人都失败了。他提到了李光耀(Lee Kuan Yew)或西班牙前独裁者佛朗哥(General Franco)。进步不仅从政坛消失，而且还普遍从公共生活中消失：曾经代表进步的英国各城市的图书馆目前正被关闭。

The success of Frozen and the fact that the audience was almost half male merited a piece in the NYTimes discussing how nervous the studio was about getting boys to see the film because it was about princesses and most boys would rather eat dirt than see a movie about a princess. On the one hand, I don't understand why we keep having to deal with princess movies. It's as if girls can't have any other "strong" role in animated films. But at least these princesses have evolved. Last year we had Princess Merida from Brave who refused to get married like she was supposed to, and now we have sisters Elsa and Anna who after the loss of their parents are left in charge of the kingdom. Poor Elsa can't control her powers and turns everything she touches into ice and is only freed by the love of her sister.

Jasmin and Casasanto leave open the question whether the effect may also be the result of subtle cultural preferences for things on the right-hand side. Additionally, they say, "There is about a 90 percent chance that the QWERTY inventor was right-handed," so it's possible that biases he carried, may have subconsciously place more likable sounds on the right. However, they say, "such implicit associations would be based on the peculiar roles these letters play in English words or sounds. The finding of similar QWERTYeffects across languages suggests that, even if English-based [biases] influenced QWERTY's design, QWERTY has now 'infected' typers of other languages with similar associations."

Abstract: Physical activity has been defined as any bodily movement produced skeletal muscles that results in energy expenditure.It is strongly endorsed as a means of staying healthy and an important avenue for social contact.Although in Australia,some studies have been conducted into the levels of physical activity in some ethnic communities,there has been a tendency to adopt a homogeneous view of culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) people rather than an ethno-specific perspective that recognises differing cultural beliefs and practices between and across language groups.This paper reports on a study that aimed to explore the concepts of,and attitudes towards, physical activity among older Hong Kong Chinese Australians resident in NSW.This study involved individual in-depth interviews and the use of open-ended questions.A total of 2informants was recruited for the study.The findings revealed that most informants did not have a clear idea about what was meant the term physical activity.Physical activity tended to a confusing and complicated term to this group.In addition,attitudes towards physical activity among this group reflect their cultural and health beliefs in preventive health care.To increase the physical activity level among older Hong Kong Chinese Australians,culturally-specific health promotion strategies might needed to tackle the misconception about and specific attitudes towards physical activity,as well as to match the holistic Chinese oncept of health maintenance.
