There are a variety of processes for 3-D printing. Some of the most widely used rely on a printer that makes objects from powdered material. A 3-D printer bears little resemblance to a document printer in an office. It has two major parts: a 'build box' that contains a smooth, thin bed of finely ground material such as pulverized stainless steel or powdered plastic; and a printing head. Depending on the type of printer, the head contains either a heat source, such as a laser or an electron beam, that melts the powdered material or jets that spray binder over the powder in a precise pattern. The binder functions as a glue for the material as an object is built.
3-D打印的类型多种多样，其中应用最广泛的是能够将粉末材料塑形的打印机。相比办公室里的文档打印机，两者几乎没有任何相似之处。3-D打印机主要有两个部分：一个装有光滑粉末微粒材料（如粉末状不锈钢或塑料）的“铸模托盘”(Build Box)和一个打印头。根据打印机型号的不同，打印头会包含一个热源或者几个喷射口。热源分为激光头或电子束，能够熔化粉末材料；喷射口则以一种精准模式向粉末材料喷射凝胶剂。在这个物体的成型过程中，凝胶剂能够像胶水一样粘合粉末材料。

3. If something makes you especially well-suited for the job aside from what's on your résumé, mention it. For example, maybe the position requires an inordinate degree of meticulousness and you frequently get teased for being obsessive about details. That's a perfect thing to mention in a cover letter, and it's information that wouldn't be found on your résumé. If you're having trouble thinking of those qualities, try thinking about what you would tell a friend if you were explaining why you were excited about this particular job and why you think you would be great at it. Does that explanation add anything that your friend couldn't get from just looking at your résumé? It probably does – and that's what you want to convey.

They tend to have extremely catchy titles, such as Executive Power, which was supposedly authored by a certain Professor Paul Thomas, who is on the Harvard Business School faculty. After selling 2 million copies, this volume of inspiration, which was said to be President Lincoln's favorite book, was found to be totally phony. There was no English original and Paul Thomas was a name the publisher created out of the blue. Harvard Mottos is another such book, but its author seems to have more flesh and blood than Paul Thomas of Executive Power. Danny Feng is reported to be a Beijinger who has studied in the United States. After the scam was exposed, Feng said he based his book on an online post by expanding on each of the 20 mottos.

Some consultants believe that Kumar's departure signals deeper issues for the school and its place among the world's elite MBA programs. Fewer students are taking jobs in fields that were once Wharton's mainstay-- investment banking and investment management. And Kumar isn't the only top official to leave in recent years. In June of last year, Yale University's School of Management hired away a highly admired long-time leader at Wharton, Anjani Jain. For Wharton, it was a major loss: Jain had a career at Wharton for over 26 years, spending 10 years as vice dean of the MBA program and his final two years there as the vice dean of the MBA program for executives.

Itchy, flaky skin can be an irritating and unsightly consequence of cold, dry air. But should you just write it off as a winter annoyance? No, says Dr. Jaliman. Dry skin, if not kept at bay, can be a portal for infection. "It's very important to keep dry skin hydrated," she says. When skin becomes dry, it can lead to small cracks that can leave your body prone to infections. To prevent this, moisturize twice daily — after you shower and before bed — as well as throughout the day for body parts that are prone to dryness, like your hands. "I like Aquaphor," says Dr. Jaliman. "It's inexpensive and effective."

In the end, the arguments over process are disputes which ought to be reconcilable. Fair supervision, a clear question for voters and a consistent electoral roll are not issues that ought to divide honest leaders. The difference between holding the vote in 2013, as London wants, or 2014, as the SNP now seems to prefer, is not unbridgeable either. The Scottish electorate must decide on the future of Scotland in a vote whose meaning and authority are beyond challenge. That is not easy when the referendum has become such a political plaything. Times are hard in Scotland as elsewhere, and the uncertainty over process and outcome, though sometimes exaggerated, should not be allowed to block all other issues facing the country. Get on with it, all of you.

"The risk of loss in leveraged foreign exchange trading can be substantial. You may sustain losses in excess of your initial margin funds. Placing contingent orders, such as" stop-loss "or" stop-limit "orders, will not necessarily limit losses to the intended amounts. Market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders. You may be called upon at short notice to deposit additional margin funds. If the required funds are not provided within the prescribed time, your position may be liquidated. You will remain liable for any resulting deficit in your account. You should therefore carefully consider whether such trading is suitable in light of your own financial position and investment objectives.".
“杠杆式外汇买卖的亏损风险可以十分重大。你所蒙受的亏损可能超过你的最初保证金款额。即使你定下备用买卖指示，例如“止蚀”或”限价”买卖指示，亦未必可以将亏损局限於你原先设想的数额。市场情况可能使这些买卖指示无法执行。你可能被要求一接到通知即存入额外的保证金款额。如你未能在所订的时间内提供所需的款额，你的未平仓合约可能会被了结。你将要为你的户口所出现的任何逆差负责。因此，你必须仔细考虑，监於自己的财务状况及投资目标，这种买卖是否适合你。”。

But Huy Vo, a senior specialist in public relations at Hawaiian, said the short flights, which make up half the airline's routes, aren't all that easy to operate.

The task at first seemed impossible: Determine if Apple's best days are behind it or if it's merely taking a break from breakneck growth and world-beating innovation. After all, how to figure out the trajectory of a company that is so tight-lipped with its plans, which prohibits its people from talking freely, even amongst themselves, a company whose new CEO speaks rarely and then in crisp, measured sentences designed to reveal as little as possible?
苹果的鼎盛时期是否已经过去，或者它只是暂时休息一下，之后将延续惊人的快速增长和举世瞩目的创新？对于这个问题，要得出明确的答案似乎是不可能完成的任务。毕竟，苹果对自己的发展规划始终守口如瓶，甚至禁止人们随意讨论这个话题。而且，苹果新任CEO很少公开讲话，即使有也非常谨慎，很少透露太多内容。面对这样一家公司，如何才能预测它的发展轨迹？

I loved Andrew McCarthy. I loved him even more when Blane really did want Andie back and sought her out at the prom. But I also struggled with the fact that I loved Jon Cryer's Duckie, too-- that his adoration for Andie seemed so simple and easy and loyal in comparison. Is it OK to pick the Blanes of the world over the Duckies? I think sometimes it is, especially when you are young and still learning about yourself and relationships. Inevitably, people are going to like my children that my children might not like back in the the same way, and vice versa. The trick, then, is to teach my children to treat people with respect and care, even if they can't return the same level of feeling. After all, you can't love someone back out of obligation. That's not the way it works.

Wherever humans have gone in the world, they have carried with them two things, language and fire. As they traveled through tropical forests they hoarded the precious embers of old fires and sheltered them from downpours. When they settled the barren Arctic, they took with them the memory of fire, and recreated it in stoneware vessels filled with animal fat. Darwin himself considered these the two most significant achievements of humanity. It is, of course, impossible to imagine a human society that does not have language, but — given the right climate and an adequacy of raw wild food — could there be a primitive tribe that survives without cooking? In fact, no such people have ever been found. Nor will they be, according to a provocative theory by Harvard biologist Richard Wrangham, who believes that fire is needed to fuel the organ that makes possible all the other products of culture, language included: the human brain.
在这个世界上，不管人们走到哪里，有两样东西总会伴随左右：语言和火。在穿过热带雨林时，人们会将燃烧着的珍贵木炭小心保存起来，以免被暴雨浇灭。当他们在茫茫北极定居，会随身携带着火种，然后在盛满动物脂肪的石器中重新点燃。达尔文认为它们是人类最重要的两大成就。一个没有语言的社会当然是不可想象的，但是，如果在一个气候适宜、野生食物充足的环境下，是不是一个原始部落就能够不靠烹饪而存活下去？事实上，尚未发现过有这种人存在。按照哈佛生物学家理查德·朗汉姆的挑战性理论，这种人也不可能存在，他认为，火为一种器官提供了燃料，这种器官使得包括语言在内的所有其他文化产物，成为可能，这个器官就是人的大脑。

This phenomenon's occurrence in many species makes evolutionary sense. For 99% of animals, stress involves a major burst of energy use as they, say, run for their lives. Afterward, the body stimulates appetite, especially for high-density calories, to rebuild depleted energy stores. But we smart, neurotic humans keep turning the stress-response on for purely psychological reasons, putting our bodies repeatedly into the restocking mode.
这种现象出现在很多物种当中，这可以从进化论角度解释。对于99%的动物来说，压力都涉及能量消耗的大幅增加。在这之后，身体刺激食欲、特别是对高热量的食欲，以重新积累耗尽的能量储备。但聪明而又神经兮兮的人类因为纯粹心理上的原因而不断出现应激反应，使我们的身体反复进入重新积累能量的模式。

An improved high-resolution current-mode sorter is presented.Its structure complexity is O(N),which is crucial to the expansion of its size,and its dynamic range is large.Only one clock signal and one reset signal are needed.No biasing signal is required.The operation point is constructed according to the input current,so it is self-adaptive,which is very important for an all-purpose component.In average value circuit,subtraction circuit,Winner-Take-All(WTA) circuit and control circuit,it has good performance even at a large input current.This sorter has high precision,high resolution and low power,as has been proved via HSPICE simulation.It can implemented in the standard digital CMOS technology and widely used in many fields,so it is of great value in applications.

The usual view of why this should be stresses traditional“son preference”in South and East Asia. Families wanted a son to bear the family name, to inherit property and to carry out funerary duties. Ms Hvistendahl has little truck with this account, which fails to explain why some of the richest, most outward -looking parts of India and China have the most skewed sex ratios. According to her account, sex -selection technologies were invented in the West, adopted there as a population -control measure and exported to East Asia by Western aid donors and American military officials.
男女比例为什么失衡，人们普遍观点认为东南亚人强调传统的“重男轻女”思想。家庭需要儿子来传宗接代，继承财产以及养老送终的职责。赫弗斯坦托尔女士的看法跟这个叙述几乎毫无共通之处。因为该叙述还是出去解释为什么印度和中国一些最富裕的，最开放的地方性别比例最不正常（或最倾斜）。根据她的解释，性别选择技术是在西方发明并被作为人口控制措施而采用的，而且被西方援助者和美国军官传播到了东亚。

Those included the idea that voicing an opinion different from the manager's would seem like a challenge to his or her ability, even if employees had seen evidence to the contrary.
思考我们上述关于权威的观点，能让所有的下属受益。迪特在2011年共同撰写并发布在《管理学会学报》上的一份研究报告指出，不管企业高管和经理实际是怎么做的，我们很多人对他们的行为都会有先入为主的看法。研究人员对一家科技公司的190名员工进行采访后发现，很多人都存在所谓的“固有”信念，缺乏证据支持、但根深蒂固。包括：就算员工看到了相反的证据，但如果发表与管理者不同的意见，就有挑战上级能力的嫌疑。
