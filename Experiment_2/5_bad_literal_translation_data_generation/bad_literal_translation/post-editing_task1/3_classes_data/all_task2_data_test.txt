Quasi -independent since 1970, the post gets no public money. And yet it is obliged( as FedEx and UPS are not) to visit every mailbox, no matter how remote, six days a week. This has driven the average cost of each piece of mail up from 34 cents in 2006 to 41 cents. Yet the post is not allowed to raise prices( of stamps and such) willy -nilly; a 2006 law set formulas for that. So in effect, the post cannot control either its costs or its revenues.
1970年，邮政服务确定其半独立的财务形式，从此，邮政局不再领取公共钱。然而，无论距离有多远，一周六天，邮差都要去所管辖的每一个邮箱中查收信件（FedEx和UPS可没这项业务）。这使得每封邮件的平均花费从2006年的34美分增加到了41美分。但不管邮政局愿意不愿意，都不能提高费用（包括邮票面值和其它种种价格）；2006年通过的一条法案对此做出了规定。所以实际上，邮政局既不能控制自己的支出，也无法保证自身的收入。

The profusion of digital technology at work, home and everywhere in between is evident to even the most causal observer. In this climate, it's understandable why many schools are interested in technological integration and innovation. While it seems clear that students will increasingly be expected to be adept at using digital tools in their professional and personal lives, there isn't great clarity on how exactly these tools should be used. Often visions and goals are nebulous — if they exist at all. We can't just buy iPads (or any device), add water, and hope that strategy will usher schools to the leading edge of 21st century education. Technology, by itself, isn't curative.

Reid says he started moving up through the executive ranks only after "I became known for calmly presenting several options, in any situation, instead of passionately insisting my way was right." People get promoted, he says, in large part because other people — especially, but not only, bosses — like working with them, and passion too often puts colleagues off. "Your best ideas will probably be adopted anyway, without your having to pound the table," he notes. "It's much more useful to forget about passion, and come across as unemotional and impartial."
里德说，只有等到“大家都知道我无论在什么情况下都能冷静地提出好几种方案（而不是充满激情地坚称我的方式是正确的），，”他才开始拾阶而上，步步高升。人们之所以获得提拔，在很大程度上是因为其他人，特别是（但不仅仅是）老板喜欢跟他们一起工作，而激情往往会引起同事的反感。“不管怎样，你最好的想法或许都会被采纳，根本没必要敲桌子，”他指出。“忘却激情，给人以冷静和公正的印象，往往更有助于你获得晋升机会。”

Fewer students are taking jobs in fields that were once Wharton's mainstay-- investment banking and investment management. And Kumar isn't the only top official to leave in recent years. In June of last year, Yale University's School of Management hired away a highly admired long-time leader at Wharton, Anjani Jain. For Wharton, it was a major loss: Jain had a career at Wharton for over 26 years, spending 10 years as vice dean of the MBA program and his final two years there as the vice dean of the MBA program for executives.
许多入学顾问认为，库马尔的辞职表明这家商学院内部存在更深层次的问题，也表明了它在全球顶尖MBA课程中的地位。沃顿商学院曾经的支柱行业是投资银行和投资管理，可如今在这些领域找到工作的学生越来越少。库马尔并不是近几年离职的唯一一位高管。去年6月份，耶鲁大学管理学院（Yale University's School of Management）挖走了沃顿一位德高望重的领导人恩贾尼•贾恩。这是沃顿的一大损失：贾恩在沃顿工作了超过26年，担任负责MBA课程的副院长已有10年时间，在学院的最后两年担任高管MBA课程副院长。

Alas for ambitious school leavers, universities cannot expand to accommodate them. That fact, as well as the cap on tuition fees, albeit at a higher level, has stymyied the development of a higher-education market. Because the Treasury must lend students the funds to pay their fees and because not all graduates clear their debts, the state limits not only how much universities charge but also how many students they can admit. During the boom years, adding places was affordable. Now it is not. A temporary expansion of places in England announced in 2010 is about to end. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where devolved administrations keep fees down for local and EU students, expansion is equally unaffordable.
对胸怀大志的中学毕业生来说遗憾的是，大学不能为了容纳他们而无限扩招。这一事实加上学费封顶（尽管封顶数额更高），阻碍了高教市场的发展。由于财政部必须贷款给学生付学费，而且并非所有毕业生都会还清债务，国家便不但限制了大学收费的数额，同时也限制了大学录取学生的数量。在经济向好的年代里，国家有财力支持扩招。但现在不行。于2010年宣布的英格兰大学临时扩招也即将结束。苏格兰、威尔士和北爱尔兰的自治政府一直对本地与欧盟学生采取低收费政策，这些地区同样无力出资扩大大学规模。

Volkswagen AG is nothing if not an engineering powerhouse, its various brands embodying traits from Porsche's performance to VW's fuel economy to Bugatti's voluptuous and curvy exteriors. The mastermind of this expertise, Prof. Dr. Hackenberg, as he is called, is the head of the automaker's research and development. He is credited with developing a new approach to design and manufacturing that optimizes variation among models from a particular platform, all of which share characteristics that allow them to be built from common parts and components. The money saved by this method, VW claims, gives it the option to equip its cars with extra features and content or to reduce price while maintaining profitability.

Another big caveat is the age issue – the coffee-death relationship was only true for people under 55 – and the reason behind this is somewhat of a mystery. It could be that people who are dying this young are already predisposed to fatal health problems in various ways, although this is somewhat speculative. Study author Chip Lavie points out that heavy coffee drinkers differ in a number of ways from less avid consumers, so there may be other, as-yet-undiscovered things going on. The authors suggest that since heart disease wasn't increased among heavy coffee drinkers, but rather death from all causes, cancer may be a culprit. "Certainly, one would think that the main non-CV cause of death would be cancer, but we did not specifically assess this. And with cancer, one would really want to know cause-specific as opposed to cancer in general – we will probably try to assess this, although this is not quite as easy as one may think."
另一个值得注意的是年龄问题。过量饮用咖啡与死亡率升高之间的关联似乎仅发生在年龄55岁以下的人群中，而其背后的原因在某种程度上也是一个谜。这些英年早逝的人或许在此前就因为各种原因存在致命的健康问题，虽然这也只是一种猜测。研究者奇普•李维指出，过量饮用咖啡的人与不那么爱喝咖啡的人，在许多方面都存在着差异，因此，这背后或许有别的未被发现的因素在起作用。研究者称，在过量饮用咖啡的人群中，心脏病的发病比例并未上升，而在各种死因之中，癌症可能是首要原因。“很明显，人们会据此认为，癌症是非心血管疾病死亡的罪魁祸首，但是我们并没有针对此做过专门的评估。对于癌症，人们也总是想知道特定原因的死亡率相对于癌症总体死亡率的情况。我们也许会尝试去做这样的评估，但这却并不像人们想得那么简单。”

From the bus station in Jingmen, we jumped into one final taxi, which would take me to the school where my new apartment was. Once again, Mr. Li sat in the front, while I sat in the back with my bags. Even though it was October, the weather was much warmer here than it was back home. With the windows rolled down, I felt the cool wind dry the dampness from my hair and face. I let out a quiet sigh, knowing that I was almost there. Over thirty hours of traveling, all in two days, was about to come to an end. I finally felt that the stressful ordeal of traveling from one country to another was almost over and even though I also knew that soon I would be confronted with the new stresses of finding my way around a city where I did not speak the language and later still I would find myself in front of a classroom for the first time, for now, I could be at peace. And as I sat there, with the strange new sounds and smells of a strange new city carried by the cool breeze across my smiling face, I heard what sounded like a deep hacking from Mr. Li. I opened my eyes just in time to see him spit out the window. I watched as the glob of yellowish liquid flew out his window, got caught by the wind, and was then thrown back into the car through my window, to land with a splatter across my forehead. I wiped the spittle from my face and smiled. I was home.

Darlene Price, author of Well Said! Presentations and Conversations That Get Results, concurs. "Words matter," she says. "They are a key component of persuasive communication. Regardless of the audience, topic, or industry, or whether the setting is a stand-up presentation, sit-down conversation, telephone discussion, or an online meeting, a leader uses language to influence someone's mind in order to achieve a certain result. That's one reason they're seen as leaders; their words compel people to follow."

Do not fall into the trap of dogma. There is no single simple answer to any question. Remember during your high school debate class, I always asked you to take on the side that you don’t believe in? I did that for a reason -- things rarely “black and white”, and there are always many ways to look at a problem. You will become a better problem solver if you recognized that. This is called “critical thinking”, and it is the most important thinking skill you need for your life. This also means you need to become tolerant and supportive of others. I will always remember when I went to my Ph.D. advisor and proposed a new thesis topic. He said “I don’t agree with you, but I’ll support you.” After the years, I have learned this isn’t just flexibility, it is encouragement of critical thinking, and an empowering style of leadership, and it has become a part of me. I hope it will become a part of you too.
不要被教条所束缚，任何问题都没有一个唯一的简单的答案。还记得当我帮助你高中的辩论课程时，我总是让你站在你不认可的那一方来辩论吗？我这么做的理由就是希望你能够理解：看待一个问题不应该非黑即白，而是有很多方法和角度。当你意识到这点的时候，你就会成为一个很好的解决问题者。这就是“批判的思维”——你的一生都会需要的最重要的思考方式，这也意味着你还需要包容和支持不同于你的其他观点。我永远记得我去找我的博士导师提出了一个新论题，他告诉我：“我不同意你，但我支持你。”多年后，我认识到这不仅仅是包容，而是一种批判式思考，更是令人折服的领导风格，现在这也变成了我的一部分。我希望这也能成为你的一部分。
