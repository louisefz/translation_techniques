Lithium-iron can't yet pack as much power into a small space as lithium-ion, but Stoker says the company is seeing rapid improvements. The technology already appears in electric cars, and may soon spill over into consumer devices as well.
K2能源公司正在研究磷酸锂铁电池。这种电池的充放电次数大约是锂离子电池的2倍，没有容量损失，而且还耐高温。要知道高温会让电池指标迅速恶化甚至报废。目前的磷酸锂铁电池还不能做的和锂电池一样小，但斯托克说他们已经取得很大进展。该技术已经应用在电动汽车上，而且将很快渗透到消费电子领域。

Quasi -independent since 1970, the post gets no public money. And yet it is obliged( as FedEx and UPS are not) to visit every mailbox, no matter how remote, six days a week. This has driven the average cost of each piece of mail up from 34 cents in 2006 to 41 cents. Yet the post is not allowed to raise prices( of stamps and such) willy -nilly; a 2006 law set formulas for that. So in effect, the post cannot control either its costs or its revenues.
1970年，邮政服务确定其半独立的财务形式，从此，邮政局不再领取公共钱。然而，无论距离有多远，一周六天，邮差都要去所管辖的每一个邮箱中查收信件（FedEx和UPS可没这项业务）。这使得每封邮件的平均花费从2006年的34美分增加到了41美分。但不管邮政局愿意不愿意，都不能提高费用（包括邮票面值和其它种种价格）；2006年通过的一条法案对此做出了规定。所以实际上，邮政局既不能控制自己的支出，也无法保证自身的收入。

One important example concerns cookstoves. The black carbon emitted from dirty cookstoves — on which millions of poor people cook — is detrimental to the health of millions of people. The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves is creating a market for low-emissions cookstoves, to help reduce the damaging health and environmental impacts of black carbon. It's an economic empowerment issue because selling and maintaining cookstoves is a new green industry, especially for women. Cooking is not the major contributor to climate change, but low-emissions cookstoves can address one aspect of it.

Fewer students are taking jobs in fields that were once Wharton's mainstay-- investment banking and investment management. And Kumar isn't the only top official to leave in recent years. In June of last year, Yale University's School of Management hired away a highly admired long-time leader at Wharton, Anjani Jain. For Wharton, it was a major loss: Jain had a career at Wharton for over 26 years, spending 10 years as vice dean of the MBA program and his final two years there as the vice dean of the MBA program for executives.

Alas for ambitious school leavers, universities cannot expand to accommodate them. That fact, as well as the cap on tuition fees, albeit at a higher level, has stymyied the development of a higher-education market. Because the Treasury must lend students the funds to pay their fees and because not all graduates clear their debts, the state limits not only how much universities charge but also how many students they can admit. During the boom years, adding places was affordable. Now it is not. A temporary expansion of places in England announced in 2010 is about to end. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where devolved administrations keep fees down for local and EU students, expansion is equally unaffordable.

Volkswagen AG is nothing if not an engineering powerhouse, its various brands embodying traits from Porsche's performance to VW's fuel economy to Bugatti's voluptuous and curvy exteriors. The mastermind of this expertise, Prof. Dr. Hackenberg, as he is called, is the head of the automaker's research and development. He is credited with developing a new approach to design and manufacturing that optimizes variation among models from a particular platform, all of which share characteristics that allow them to be built from common parts and components. The money saved by this method, VW claims, gives it the option to equip its cars with extra features and content or to reduce price while maintaining profitability.
大众汽车公司具有曲线美的迷人外观，大众旗下的众多品牌都体现了自己的特色。这一切背后的主要智囊人物——人们所称的“教授哈肯伯格博士”——是这家汽车制造商的研发部门的领袖。他开发了全新的设计和制造方式，根据特定平台优化了各车型的差异性，使得这些车型拥有了一些共同特点，从而可以采用通用部件来进行装配。大众表示，利用这种方法节约的成本能够让公司给汽车增加其他特色和功能，或者在保证利润率的情况下降低售价。

Another big caveat is the age issue – the coffee-death relationship was only true for people under 55 – and the reason behind this is somewhat of a mystery. It could be that people who are dying this young are already predisposed to fatal health problems in various ways, although this is somewhat speculative. Study author Chip Lavie points out that heavy coffee drinkers differ in a number of ways from less avid consumers, so there may be other, as-yet-undiscovered things going on. The authors suggest that since heart disease wasn't increased among heavy coffee drinkers, but rather death from all causes, cancer may be a culprit. "Certainly, one would think that the main non-CV cause of death would be cancer, but we did not specifically assess this. And with cancer, one would really want to know cause-specific as opposed to cancer in general – we will probably try to assess this, although this is not quite as easy as one may think."
另一个值得注意的是年龄问题。过量饮用咖啡与死亡率升高之间的关联似乎仅发生在年龄55岁以下的人群中，而其背后的原因在某种程度上也是一个谜。这些英年早逝的人或许在此前就因为各种原因存在致命的健康问题，虽然这也只是一种猜测。研究者奇普•李维指出，过量饮用咖啡的人与不那么爱喝咖啡的人，在许多方面都存在着差异，因此，这背后或许有别的未被发现的因素在起作用。研究者称，在过量饮用咖啡的人群中，心脏病的发病比例并未上升，而在各种死因之中，癌症可能是首要原因。“很明显，人们会据此认为，癌症是非心血管疾病死亡的罪魁祸首，但是我们并没有针对此做过专门的评估。对于癌症，人们也总是想知道特定原因的死亡率相对于癌症总体死亡率的情况。我们也许会尝试去做这样的评估，但这却并不像人们想得那么简单。”

From the bus station in Jingmen, we jumped into one final taxi, which would take me to the school where my new apartment was. Once again, Mr. Li sat in the front, while I sat in the back with my bags. Even though it was October, the weather was much warmer here than it was back home. With the windows rolled down, I felt the cool wind dry the dampness from my hair and face. I let out a quiet sigh, knowing that I was almost there. Over thirty hours of traveling, all in two days, was about to come to an end. I finally felt that the stressful ordeal of traveling from one country to another was almost over and even though I also knew that soon I would be confronted with the new stresses of finding my way around a city where I did not speak the language and later still I would find myself in front of a classroom for the first time, for now, I could be at peace. And as I sat there, with the strange new sounds and smells of a strange new city carried by the cool breeze across my smiling face, I heard what sounded like a deep hacking from Mr. Li. I opened my eyes just in time to see him spit out the window. I watched as the glob of yellowish liquid flew out his window, got caught by the wind, and was then thrown back into the car through my window, to land with a splatter across my forehead. I wiped the spittle from my face and smiled. I was home.

Don't be afraid to say no to expansion opportunities. Decide what key success factor a new location must meet-- whether that's foot traffic or drive-by traffic or the presence of a cluster of similar stores--and if you're not going to be able to satisfy those criteria, don't go there. Consider Southwest Airlines as an example. One reason they're so successful is that they've said no to expansion opportunities if there wasn't enough demand on a particular route to make it worthwhile.
不要害怕对扩张机会说“不”。确定扩张成功需要满足的关键要素——无论原因是因为那里走路就能到达，还是因为正好顺路，还是因为周围有许多类似的店面——如果你无法满足这些标准，就不要去那里扩张。想想美国西南航空公司的例子。他们之所以能够取得今天成功，原因之一在于，如果特定线路没有足够的需求，不值得扩张，他们就会对否决这个计划。
