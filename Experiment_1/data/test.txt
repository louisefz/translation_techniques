Abstract: Numerical simulation by CFD was carried out to understand the hot current behavior in a tunnel with longitudinal ventilation.It becomes clear that fire source modeling is very important because the hot current behavior is strongly affected by the fire source position and is sensitive to methods in the modeling of the fire source.The flame area which has developed from the fire source is an area of chemical reaction caused by combustion.Even if grids in the vicinity of the fire source are made fine,it was difficult to simulate the heat generation area with consideration to this chemical reaction through using a method for setting the heat release rate simply on the fire source surface.Therefore,we proposed a method adopting the knowledge on flame shape under the longitudinal ventilation and incorporating it into numerical simulation and it showed a good agreement with the experimental results.It was shown through experiments in a tunnel with longitudinal ventilation that the hot current developed toward the tunnel center downwind from the fire source near a wall.The cause was investigated by numerical simulation and it became clear from the results that the spiral air by the fire plume created a vortex in the crevice between the wall and the plume.

The U.S. only invested 23% more than China in Sub-Saharan Africa from 2007 through 2011, and the GAO suspects that even its approximation might be underestimating Chinese investment in the continent.

Abstract: Physical activity has been defined as any bodily movement produced skeletal muscles that results in energy expenditure.It is strongly endorsed as a means of staying healthy and an important avenue for social contact.Although in Australia,some studies have been conducted into the levels of physical activity in some ethnic communities,there has been a tendency to adopt a homogeneous view of culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) people rather than an ethno-specific perspective that recognises differing cultural beliefs and practices between and across language groups.This paper reports on a study that aimed to explore the concepts of,and attitudes towards, physical activity among older Hong Kong Chinese Australians resident in NSW.This study involved individual in-depth interviews and the use of open-ended questions.A total of 2informants was recruited for the study.The findings revealed that most informants did not have a clear idea about what was meant the term physical activity.Physical activity tended to a confusing and complicated term to this group.In addition,attitudes towards physical activity among this group reflect their cultural and health beliefs in preventive health care.To increase the physical activity level among older Hong Kong Chinese Australians,culturally-specific health promotion strategies might needed to tackle the misconception about and specific attitudes towards physical activity,as well as to match the holistic Chinese oncept of health maintenance.
文摘:身体活动指由骨骼肌产生的体能消耗运动,是保持身体健康、增进社会交往的重要方式和途径.在澳大利亚,虽然有研究调查民族群体身体活动的各个层面,但总体而言,多数研究更侧重于民族群体的同质性,而忽视了其异质性.本研究探讨在新南威尔士州居住的澳籍香港老年华人对身体活动的概念理解及对身体活动的态度.研究使用开放性问卷进行个体深度访谈,受访者22人.研究发现,大多数受访者不清楚身体活动这一术语的含义,对他们来说,身体活动是一个模糊的、复杂的术语.该群体对身体活动的态度反映了他们在预防性卫生保健方面的文化和健康观念.显然,提升澳籍香港老年华人的身体活动水平,需要一种基于文化特殊性的健康促进策略以解决对身体活动的误解,同时也需要具体的身体活动态度与华人整体性保健观念相匹配.

The workers also give money, or put money into the 401( k). In some companies, the worker is the only one that puts money into the 401( k), but in some companies–in most companies both the company and the employee( the person working at the company)“contribute,”or put money into this account, and you invest that money. You put it in stocks or other financial“instruments,”as they’re called–other financial investments, and you hope you will have more money when you retire. 401( k) s are usually accounts that you don’t have to pay taxes on when you put the money in. You have to pay taxes, typically, when you take the money out when you retire.
“Retirement”指停止工作后的时间。在美国，退休时间通常在62至65岁。 Carlos: “是啊，我退休后也会很好。我已经通过工作交了几年的401(k)了。” “401(k)”是美国一项特殊的退休账户，雇主为雇员的退休养老存钱。雇员也要承担，或者把钱存进401(k)。在有些公司只有雇员把钱存进401(k),但在大部分的公司雇员和雇主都要付的，或者存进去，这也是一种投资。你可以拿它投资股票或其他金融工具，就是他们说的金融投资，你希望在退休时可以拿到更多钱。 401(k)通常在存入时是不用交税的。但是在退休后拿钱出来就要交税了。

Another big caveat is the age issue – the coffee-death relationship was only true for people under 55 – and the reason behind this is somewhat of a mystery. It could be that people who are dying this young are already predisposed to fatal health problems in various ways, although this is somewhat speculative. Study author Chip Lavie points out that heavy coffee drinkers differ in a number of ways from less avid consumers, so there may be other, as-yet-undiscovered things going on. The authors suggest that since heart disease wasn't increased among heavy coffee drinkers, but rather death from all causes, cancer may be a culprit. "Certainly, one would think that the main non-CV cause of death would be cancer, but we did not specifically assess this. And with cancer, one would really want to know cause-specific as opposed to cancer in general – we will probably try to assess this, although this is not quite as easy as one may think."
另一个值得注意的是年龄问题。过量饮用咖啡与死亡率升高之间的关联似乎仅发生在年龄55岁以下的人群中，而其背后的原因在某种程度上也是一个谜。这些英年早逝的人或许在此前就因为各种原因存在致命的健康问题，虽然这也只是一种猜测。研究者奇普•李维（Chip Lavie）指出，过量饮用咖啡的人与不那么爱喝咖啡的人，在许多方面都存在着差异，因此，这背后或许有别的未被发现的因素在起作用。研究者称，在过量饮用咖啡的人群中，心脏病的发病比例并未上升，而在各种死因之中，癌症可能是首要原因。“很明显，人们会据此认为，癌症是非心血管疾病死亡的罪魁祸首，但是我们并没有针对此做过专门的评估。对于癌症，人们也总是想知道特定原因的死亡率相对于癌症总体死亡率的情况。我们也许会尝试去做这样的评估，但这却并不像人们想得那么简单。”

In the end, the arguments over process are disputes which ought to be reconcilable. Fair supervision, a clear question for voters and a consistent electoral roll are not issues that ought to divide honest leaders.

The Scottish electorate must decide on the future of Scotland in a vote whose meaning and authority are beyond challenge. That is not easy when the referendum has become such a political plaything. Times are hard in Scotland as elsewhere, and the uncertainty over process and outcome, though sometimes exaggerated, should not be allowed to block all other issues facing the country.

The perfect technology would directly measure one's brain activity and somehow translate that into the number of sexual thoughts one had, but even that might prove very difficult.

"Thoughts aren't like distances we can measure in centimetres, metres and kilometres. So what constitutes a thought, anyway? How big does it need to be to count? Have you had none, one or many while reading this?"

Bestselling writer Anne Lamott famously captures this idea in a childhood story from her popular book, Bird By Bird. Her 10-year-old brother had been assigned a school report about birds and hadn't started on it until the night before it was due. "We were out at our family cabin in Bolinas, and he was at the kitchen table close to tears, surrounded by binder paper and pencils and unopened books on birds, immobilized by the hugeness of the task ahead. Then my father sat down beside him, put his arm around my brother's shoulder, and said, 'Bird by bird, buddy. Just take it bird by bird.'"
畅销书作家安妮•拉莫特在著名作品《一点一点来》（Bird By Bird）中讲述了一个童年故事，极好地描述了这一观点。她10岁的哥哥要写一篇关于鸟类的报告交给学校，却在截止日的前一天晚上还没开始动笔。“我们在波里那斯的家庭小木屋里度假。他坐在厨房的餐桌边，周围满是活页纸、铅笔和还没打开过的鸟类书籍。面对这一庞大的任务，他不知所措，都快要哭出来了。这时，我的父亲坐到他旁边，用胳膊搂住他的肩膀说：‘一点一点来，孩子。一点一点来就好。’”

Maureen Mahoney, the dean of the college at Smith College, and Barbara Cervone, president of the education non-profit What Kids Can Do both noted that medical problems — particularly lagging dental care or undiagnosed learning disabilities — can cause significant snags for poor students who might already be reeling from the academic culture shock. Cervone remembers one high achieving student from the Dominican Republic who, in her freshman year at Wellesley, found she had several rotting teeth, which couldn't be fixed because the university's health policy wouldn't cover it. After a petition to the college president, the policy changed and the student was able to get the care she needed and continue with her studies. But the situation highlights how proactive students have to be to procure the funds and care they might need.

No company that falls behind the competition is guilty of standing completely still. But sometimes our efforts fail because of the level of commitment to change. "I'll try" can become a half-hearted promise of follow-through rather than decisive action. Stanford d. school academic director Bernie Roth demonstrates this idea with a brief exercise that his students say delivers a lasting message. He holds out a water bottle and asks them to try to take it from him. Facing grey-haired Bernie, a 50-year veteran of the Stanford Design Program, students usually hesitate as they try to grab it from him. Their initial efforts yield nothing. His grasp just grows more ironclad as the strapping 20-year-olds and powerful CEOs try to wrestle the bottle away from the octogenarian.
在竞争中落后的公司没有哪家是因为完全的原地踏步才失败的。不过有时候我们的努力会由于投入变革的程度不足而付诸东流。“我会试试的”更有可能会变成三心二意、半途而废的承诺，而非果断的行动。斯坦福大学设计学院（Stanford d.school）教务主任伯尼•罗斯通过一个实验验证了自己的这个观点。他的学生说，实验虽然简短，传达的信息却意味深长。他抓着一瓶水，让学生们试着把它从他手中拿走。面对这位头发花白，在斯坦福设计项目组（Stanford Design Program）工作了50年的老教授，学生们在抢走水瓶时往往会犹豫。他们最初的尝试毫无所获。面对着高大魁梧的年轻人和位高权重的首席执行官的争夺，这位八十多岁老人的手抓得越来越紧。
